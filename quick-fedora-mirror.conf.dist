# Configuration file for quick-fedora-mirror
# This file is sourced by the shell and must be in valid sh syntax.

#### Required settings
# Required: The the directory holding your copy of all of the modules you
# mirror.  Does not include any module name
DESTD=

# Required: The file in which to store the last mirror time.
# Note: this really should not be in the repository itself.
TIMEFILE=

# Other settings
# The remote host to rsync from, not including a module name
# REMOTE=rsync://dl.fedoraproject.org

# The master module, which holds the other modules
# MASTERMODULE=fedora-buffet

# Tier 1 Fedora mirrors should uncomment the following to get the proper
# pre-bitflip content.
# MASTERMODULE=fedora-buffet0
# PREBITFLIP=1

# Define if the entire repository (all modules under fedora-buffet) should be
# mirrored.  If set, MODULES (below) is ignored
# MIRRORBUFFET=

# An array containing the modules to be mirrored
# MODULES=(fedora-enchilada fedora-epel)

# The name of the file holding the file list on the mirror host Note: the
# string '$mdir' will be replaced with the name of the current module directory
# in context, and so the '$' must be escaped or the string quoted.
# FILELIST='fullfiletimelist-$mdir'

# An array of extra file lists to be transferred.  They won't be processed, but
# will implicitly be included in every transfer because file lists can't be
# included in the file lists.  '$mdir' is substituted as above.
# EXTRAFILES=(fullfilelist imagelist-\$mdir)

# Mapping of MODULES to directory names, as an associative array
# MODULEMAPPING=(fedora-alt alt  fedora-archive archive
#                fedora-enchilada fedora  fedora-epel epel)

# rsync binary
# RSYNC=/usr/bin/rsync

# curl binary (only if MirrorManager checkins are enabled; see below).
# CURL=/usr/bin/curl

# Array of default options to pass to rsync
# Will be modified automatically according to VERBOSITY level; no need to set
# -q, -v or --info here.
# You can add excludes here, but the script will always detect those files as
# missing and will add them back to the file list.  This may generate
# complaints from rsync, but should not cause any problems.
# Note that some of these options may be required for proper operation of the
# script.
# RSYNCOPTS=(-aSH -f 'R .~tmp~' --stats --preallocate --delay-updates --out-format='@ %i  %n%L')

# By default quick-fedora-mirror will try to detect and recover from an aborted
# rsync run by moving any already downloaded files into place before
# processing,  Define NORSYNCRECOVERY (to anything) to prevent this.
# NORSYNCRECOVERY=

# Define KEEPDIRTIMES (to anything) to make a third rsync call which restores
# the timestamps of any directories which were modified after file removal.
# This won't ensure that timestamps are always up to date, but its good enough
# if you don't modify your repository locally.  Maintaining directory
# timestamps isn't important for mirroring in any case.
# KEEPDIRTIMES=

# DEFINE CHECKIN_SITE and CHECKIN_PASSWORD to perform a mirrormanager checkin
# at the completion of the run if rsync succeeded without error.
# CHECKIN_HOST will default to the output of the hostname command.   Set it if necessary.
# This requires that "curl" be installed; see CURL above if it's not in /usr/bin.
# CHECKIN_SITE=
# CHECKIN_PASSWORD=
# CHECKIN_HOST=

# If you have configured multiple mirrormanager hostnames to and virtually
# spread the modules/categories you mirror between them, then you can configure
# per-module checkin hosts as follows.  If you don't, then the CHECKIN_HOST you
# set above, or the default, will apply.  Note that the module name is used,
# not the mirrormanager category, and that '-' in the module name is replaced
# by '_' to make a legal variable name.
# CHECKIN_HOST_fedora_archive
# CHECKIN_HOST_fedora_alt

# Verbosity levels - info sent to stdout; usually this gets mailed to root when
# being run by cron
# 0 - quiet
# 1 - quiet if no changes, otherwise basic transfer info
# 2 - no -q to rsync
# 3 - very slightly more verbosity
# 4 - One -v to rsync
# 5 - Another -v to rsync
# 6 - Output of all settings
# 7 - Add --progress to rsync
# 8 - Shell script trace
# VERBOSE=0

# Define (to anything) to enable logging to the systemd journal (via
# systemd-cat).  the identifier "quick-fedora-mirror" is used, so logs can be
# retrieved with: journalctl -t quick-fedora-mirror
# LOGJOURNAL=

# Define to a full path to enable logging to that file.
# The provided file must already exist and be writable.
# Is only considered if LOGJOURNAL above is not defined.
# LOGFILE=

# Logging fields - Each character selects a piece of information to log.
# @ - Absolutely everything.
# a - aborted run recovery
# A - each recovered file from an aborted run
# c - rsync calls
# C - rsync call completions
# d - File/directory deletion start/end
# D - all file/directory deletes
# e - minor errors
# E - serious errors
# F - all transferred files (not impl)
# g - file list generation start/end
# k - lock contention
# l - per-module local file list generation (recursive find) start/end
# m - mirrormanager checkin
# M - mirrormanager checkin detail
# n - lack of updates in a run
# N - lack of updates in a module
# o - remote file list download start/end
# p - module processing start/end
# p - per-module module processing start/end
# r - run start
# R - run end
# s - Basic transfer statistics
# S - Detailed transfer statistics
# t - directory time updates (not impl)
# LOGITEMS=aeElrRs

# When q-f-m fails to run becuse it is already running, it checks the time
# since the last successful run.  If that is larger than this value, it logs a
# serious error.  Thid helps to detect a hung run or issues with slow
# transfers.
# WARNDELAY=$((60 * 60 * 24)) # One day

# When q-f-m encounters an error calling rsync, it may (depending on the error)
# sleep and retry.  It will always sleep with exponential backup.  Set
# MAXRETRIES to limit the number of times it retries.
# MAXRETRIES=10

# mktemp will be called after this file is sourced to make a temporary
# directory.  This directory can contain a large amount of data, and that data
# is specified by the server.  If your /tmp is small and you are concerned
# about the server potentially sending extra-huge files and filling things up,
# you can set TMPDIR here.
# TMPDIR=

# A regular expression used to filter the file lists. It must be quoted (or
# very carefully escaped). Entries matching this expression will not be synced
# and are expected not to be present locally. They will also be ignored by
# quick-fedora-hardlink. Cannot contain commas. Run against the file list that
# includes sizes (by quick-fedora-mirror) and the fullfiletimelist (by
# quick-fedora-hardlink), so don't use expressions that would match those
# metadata (which are digit strings and single characters). Example is a heavy
# filter which gives you an x86_64-only mirror with source packages, debuginfo
# packages, Alpha and Beta releases, and most image files excluded.
# FILTEREXP='(/i386|/armhfp|/source|/SRPMS|/debug/|\.iso|\.img|\.qcow2|\.raw\.xz|\.box|/releases/test)'
