Need tests for:

File list outdated version
File list corrupted

File list filtering
  Implemented for mirror; needs to be implemented for hardlinker.

Aborted rsync run cleanup.
  No good way to kill rsync in the middle of a transfer.  Maybe fake this?
  Maybe chmod 000 some directory in the tree without updating the file list?

Some checks on the format of file list generation across multiple python
versions.
