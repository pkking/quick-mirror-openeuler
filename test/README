This directory holds a simple test suite.  It makes use of shunit2, but that's
not included.  Fedora packages it, and it will be found if that package is
installed.  You can also download it to this directory.  Get it from
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kward/shunit2/master/source/2.1/src/shunit2
Finally, you can install it wherever you like and provide the path in $SHUNIT.

Should probably add some simple instructions on creating tests....
